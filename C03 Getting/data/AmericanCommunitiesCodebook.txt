For 35 Census codes that were aggregated or used the XX description for
SOC, the Census description is used for the SOC title.

** These codes are pseudo codes developed by the Census Bureau and are not
official or equivalent NAICS or SOC codes.
Legend to Identify NAICS Equivalents
M = Multiple NAICS codes
P = Part of a NAICS code - NAICS code split between two or more Census
codes
S = Not specified Industry in NAICS sector - Specific to Census codes
only
Z = Exception to NAICS code - Part of NAICS industry but has a unique
Census code
Note for both Industry and Occupation lists in Data Dictionary:
NOTE: For additional information on NAICS and SOC groupings
within major categories visit our website at:
www.census.gov/hhes/www/ioindex.html.
NOTE: The World Area of Birth (WAOB) in the PUMS dataset is based upon the
Place of Birth (POB) variable in the full dataset, not the Place of Birth
recode created for PUMS (POBP). POB contains more detailed place of birth

information than POBP.

Therefore, WAOB cannot be recoded from POBP.

Data users should be aware that the area groupings for WAOB are based
primarily upon United States administrative boundaries, not geographic
boundaries. For example, Guam is grouped into "Puerto Rico and the U.S.
Island Areas," although geographically it is located in Oceania. Not all
places of birth are listed individually in POBP. Therefore the user
cannot recreate an exact world area of birth variable from POBP based upon
geographic location of birth.
